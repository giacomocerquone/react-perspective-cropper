## Intro

react-perspective-cropper doesn't, yet, do live borders recognition like some famous mobile apps.<br />
Though it exports a main `<Cropper />` component which given an image it renders a cropper component with an already applied but editable crop area.<br />
You **must** pass an img through the `src` prop otherwise the component won't be rendered. Using its ref you have:

- a `done` async method that you can call and it will return the cropped and filtered image and you have the option to also show a preview of the edited image!
- a `backToCrop` method to use **only** if you requested for a preview in the done.

<br />

If you have special needs, please open a issue and we'll discuss it there!

## Install

```bash
npm i react-perspective-cropper
```

or

```bash
yarn add react-perspective-cropper
```

## Props

```typescript
export interface CropperProps {
  image: string | File
  onDragStop: () => void
  onChange: () => void
  cropperRef: React.ElementRef
  pointSize: number
  lineWidth: number

  pointBorder: string // css border property value
  lineColor: string
  maxWidth: number
  maxHeight: number

}
```
## OpenCV Filter Props
```typescript
export interface filterCvParams = {
  blur: boolean,
  th: boolean,
  thMode: number, //provided by OpenCV
  thMeanCorrection: number,
  thBlockSize: number,
  thMax: number,
  grayScale: boolean,
}
```
## Usage

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import Cropper from 'react-perspective-cropper'

const App = () => {
  const [cropState, setCropState] = useState()
  const [img, setImg] = useState()
  const [inputKey, setInputKey] = useState(0)
  const cropperRef = useRef()

  const onDragStop = useCallback((s) => setCropState(s), [])
  const onChange = useCallback((s) => setCropState(s), [])

  const doSomething = async () => {
    console.log(cropState)
    try {
      const res = await cropperRef.current.done({ preview: true })
      console.log(res)
    } catch (e) {
      console.log('error', e)
    }
  }

  const onImgSelection = async (e) => {
    if (e.target.files && e.target.files.length > 0) {
      // it can also be a http or base64 string for example
      setImg(e.target.files[0])
    }
  }

  return (
    <Cropper
      ref={cropperRef}
      image={img}
      onChange={onChange}
      onDragStop={onDragStop}
    />
    <input
      type='file'
      key={inputKey}
      onChange={onImgSelection}
      accept='image/*'
    />
    <button onClick={doSomething}>Ho finito</button>
  )
}
```

## Applying Filters Example

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import Cropper from 'react-perspective-cropper'

const App = () => {
  const [cropState, setCropState] = useState()
  const [img, setImg] = useState()
  const [inputKey, setInputKey] = useState(0)
  const cropperRef = useRef()

  const onDragStop = useCallback((s) => setCropState(s), [])
  const onChange = useCallback((s) => setCropState(s), [])

  const doSomething = async () => {
    console.log(cropState)
    try {
      // Get the OpenCV ref
      const { cv } = cropperRef.current;
      // Declare the filter params that should be applied to the cropped image
      const filter = { 
        blur: false,
        th: true,
        thMode: cv.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_MEAN_C,
        thMeanCorrection: 15,
        thBlockSize: 25,
        thMax: 255,
        grayScale: true,
      };
      
      const res = await cropperRef.current.done({ 
        preview: true,
        filterCvParams: filter
      })
      console.log(res)
    } catch (e) {
      console.log('error', e)
    }
  }

  const onImgSelection = async (e) => {
    if (e.target.files && e.target.files.length > 0) {
      // it can also be a http or base64 string for example
      setImg(e.target.files[0])
    }
  }

  return (
    <Cropper
      ref={cropperRef}
      image={img}
      onChange={onChange}
      onDragStop={onDragStop}
    />
    <input
      type='file'
      key={inputKey}
      onChange={onImgSelection}
      accept='image/*'
    />
    <button onClick={doSomething}>Ho finito</button>
  )
}
```


## OpenCV

This cropper uses OpenCV for border recognition, perspective transformation and b&w thresholding. In order to use it, I've created this other handy wrapper around it: [opencv-react](https://github.com/giacomocerquone/opencv-react)<br/>
If you're already using it or if you're importing OpenCV manually in a different way, **this lib got you covered as long as you provide the OpenCV instance in `window.cv` and the component isn't rendered before OpenCV finished loading**. <br/>
So, be careful.

## OpenCV async loading

The openCV library is really big (approx. 1mb for the entire js file).<br/>
Now, opencv-react uses the `document.createElement('script')` browser function to inject this script and that's equal to writing `<script src="..."></script>` in your html page. The parsing of the js file from the browser is done synchronously and we don't want this since it'd block the js thread.<br/>
The solution, which is already implemented in the opencv-react lib, is to use the keyword async in front of the script tag. This won't block the thread but still **you gotta decide** when to load it.<br/><br/>
Basically I can imagine many, if not all, of you will render this component under certain conditions; well you need to know that doing so you'll start fetching and asynchronously parsing the library only when you'll render this cropper component.<br/>
If you wanna start fetching the lib as soon as your app is opened, then you want to wrap your entire app with the opencv-react provider and then render the component whenever you want. The cropper will surely start faster, straight away.

## OpenCV locally or from CDN

You might be asking yourself this question. Well, openCV or not, the answer doesn't differ based on the libs you need in your project.<br/>
Always fewer js devs import stuff from cdns nowadays (think about `npm i`). If you notice the example folder the lib is loaded locally.<br/>
But this lib doesn't decide this on your behalf. Do what you think is best :)

## Nice to have

It would be nice to have a react-doc-scan component which uses a webcam featuring live borders recognition.

## Inspiration and help

Huge thanks to [ngx-document-scanner](https://github.com/roiperlman/ngx-document-scanner) which served me quite some openCV and canvas code to use.
